# Canonical Repository Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up a canonical repository after scaffolding it with `agconf canonical init`.

## Overview

A **canonical repository** is the source of truth for your organization's engineering standards and AI agent skills. Downstream repositories sync from this canonical repository to receive updates.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Create a new directory (or use existing)
mkdir my-standards && cd my-standards
git init

# 2. Scaffold the canonical repository structure
agconf canonical init

# 3. Edit the generated files (see sections below)

# 4. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Initial canonical repository setup"
git push -u origin main
```

## Directory Structure

After running `canonical init`, you'll have:

```
my-standards/
├── agconf.yaml              # Repository configuration
├── instructions/
│   └── AGENTS.md                # Global engineering standards
├── skills/
│   └── example-skill/           # Example skill (optional)
│       ├── SKILL.md
│       └── references/
├── rules/                       # Modular rule files (optional)
│   └── code-style.md
├── agents/                      # Sub-agent definitions (optional)
│   └── reviewer.md
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        ├── sync-reusable.yml    # Reusable workflow for syncing
        └── check-reusable.yml   # Reusable workflow for file checks
```

## Configuration Files

agconf uses two distinct configuration files:

| File | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `agconf.yaml` | Canonical repo | Defines content structure, targets, markers |
| `.agconf/config.yaml` | Downstream repos | User preferences for how sync operates |

The canonical config defines **what** content exists and how it's organized. The downstream config defines **how** sync operations behave. They serve different purposes and are never mixed.

### `agconf.yaml` (Canonical Config)

This is the main configuration file for your canonical repository:

```yaml
version: "1"
meta:
  name: my-standards           # Unique identifier
  organization: ACME Corp      # Your organization name (optional)
content:
  instructions: instructions/AGENTS.md
  skills_dir: skills           # Directory for reusable skills
  rules_dir: rules             # Optional - modular project instructions
  agents_dir: agents           # Optional - Claude Code sub-agents
targets:
  - claude                     # Supported AI agents: "claude" or "codex"
markers:
  prefix: agconf               # Marker prefix for managed content
merge:
  preserve_repo_content: true  # Preserve downstream repo-specific content
```

**Customization options:**

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `meta.name` | Unique identifier for your standards | Directory name |
| `meta.organization` | Display name for your org | (none) |
| `content.rules_dir` | Directory for modular rules (optional) | (none) |
| `content.agents_dir` | Directory for Claude sub-agents (optional) | (none) |
| `targets` | AI agent platforms to support | `["claude"]` |
| `markers.prefix` | Prefix for content markers | `agconf` |

### `instructions/AGENTS.md`

This file contains your global engineering standards that will be synced to all downstream repositories. Edit this file to include:

- Company-wide coding standards
- Required practices and patterns
- Documentation requirements
- Testing guidelines
- Security policies

**Example structure:**

```markdown
# ACME Corp Engineering Standards for AI Agents

## Purpose
These standards ensure consistency across all engineering projects.

## Development Principles

### Code Quality
- Write clean, readable code
- Follow existing patterns
- ...

## Language-Specific Standards

### Python
- Use type hints
- ...

### TypeScript
- Enable strict mode
- ...
```

## Skills

Skills are reusable instructions that can be invoked by AI agents. Each skill lives in its own directory under `skills/`.

### Creating a Skill

1. Create a directory: `skills/my-skill/`
2. Add a `SKILL.md` file with frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Brief description of what this skill does
---

# My Skill

## When to Use
Describe when this skill should be invoked.

## Instructions
Step-by-step instructions for the AI agent.

## Examples
Provide concrete examples.
```

### Skill References

If your skill needs additional files (templates, examples, etc.), place them in `skills/my-skill/references/`:

```
skills/my-skill/
├── SKILL.md
└── references/
    ├── template.yaml
    └── example.ts
```

## Rules

Rules are modular, topic-specific project instructions that allow you to organize standards by topic rather than putting everything in a single AGENTS.md file.

### Configuration

Add `rules_dir` to your canonical `agconf.yaml`:

```yaml
content:
  instructions: instructions/AGENTS.md
  skills_dir: skills
  rules_dir: rules  # Path to rules directory
```

### Directory Structure

Rules support arbitrary subdirectory nesting:

```
canonical-repo/
├── agconf.yaml
├── instructions/
├── skills/
└── rules/
    ├── code-style.md
    ├── security/
    │   ├── api-auth.md
    │   └── data-handling.md
    └── testing/
        └── unit-tests.md
```

### Creating a Rule

Each rule is a markdown file that can optionally include frontmatter with `paths` for conditional loading:

```markdown
---
paths:
  - "src/api/**/*.ts"
  - "lib/api/**/*.ts"
---

# API Authentication Rules

## Overview
All API endpoints must implement proper authentication...

## Requirements
1. Use JWT tokens
2. Validate on every request
...
```

### Target-Specific Behavior

**Claude Code**: Rules are copied to `.claude/rules/` preserving the directory structure. Each rule file gets metadata frontmatter (`agconf_managed`, `agconf_content_hash`, `agconf_source_path`) added to track sync status.

```
downstream-repo/
└── .claude/
    └── rules/
        ├── code-style.md
        ├── security/
        │   └── api-auth.md
        └── testing/
            └── unit-tests.md
```

**GitHub Copilot**: Rules are concatenated into AGENTS.md under a `# Project Rules` section between `<!-- agconf:rules:start/end -->` markers. Heading levels are automatically adjusted (h1 becomes h2, etc.) to nest properly. Source attribution comments (`<!-- Rule: path/to/rule.md -->`) are included for each rule.

For Copilot, `paths` frontmatter is included as comments since Copilot doesn't support conditional loading:

```markdown
<!-- agconf:rules:start -->
# Project Rules

<!-- Rule: security/api-auth.md -->
<!-- Applies to: src/api/**/*.ts, lib/api/**/*.ts -->
## API Authentication Rules
...
<!-- agconf:rules:end -->
```

## Agents

Agents are Claude Code sub-agents that define specialized AI assistants for specific tasks. Each agent is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter.

### Configuration

Add `agents_dir` to your canonical `agconf.yaml`:

```yaml
content:
  instructions: instructions/AGENTS.md
  skills_dir: skills
  agents_dir: agents  # Path to agents directory
targets:
  - claude  # Agents only work with Claude Code
```

### Directory Structure

Agents are stored as flat files in the agents directory:

```
canonical-repo/
├── agconf.yaml
├── instructions/
├── skills/
└── agents/
    ├── code-reviewer.md
    ├── test-writer.md
    └── doc-planner.md
```

### Creating an Agent

Each agent requires frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code changes for quality and best practices
tools:
  - Read
  - Grep
  - Bash
---

# Code Reviewer Agent

You are a code reviewer. Your job is to analyze code changes and provide constructive feedback.

## Review Process

1. Read the files that were changed
2. Check for common issues
3. Provide specific suggestions
...
```

### Target-Specific Behavior

**Claude Code**: Agents are copied to `.claude/agents/` as flat files. Metadata frontmatter (`agconf_managed`, `agconf_content_hash`) is added for change tracking.

```
downstream-repo/
└── .claude/
    └── agents/
        ├── code-reviewer.md
        ├── test-writer.md
        └── doc-planner.md
```

**GitHub Copilot**: Not supported. Copilot does not have sub-agents. When agents exist in the canonical repository but only Codex target is configured, a warning is displayed and agents are skipped.

## GitHub Workflows

The scaffolded workflows in `.github/workflows/` are **reusable workflows** that downstream repositories call. The repository references are automatically populated based on your organization and repository name.

### CLI Installation

The generated workflow files install the `agconf` CLI with a pinned version:

```yaml
- name: Install agconf CLI
  run: npm install -g agconf@1.2.0
```

The version is automatically set to the CLI version used when running `agconf canonical init`. This ensures consistent behavior between local development and CI.

### How Reusable Workflows Work

1. Your canonical repository hosts the reusable workflows
2. Downstream repositories reference them with `uses: org/repo/.github/workflows/file.yml@ref`
3. When downstream repos run CI, they call your workflows
4. Your workflows run the `agconf` CLI commands

### Workflow Customization

The generated workflows are templates. Customize them based on your needs:

- Add additional steps (notifications, approvals, etc.)
- Modify the schedule for sync workflows
- Add environment-specific logic
- Configure reviewers for auto-generated PRs

## Publishing Your Canonical Repository

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

```bash
# Create the repository on GitHub (via web or gh CLI)
gh repo create my-org/engineering-standards --private

# Push your local repository
git remote add origin git@github.com:my-org/engineering-standards.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Create a Release

Downstream repositories pin to specific versions. Create releases using semantic versioning:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

# Or use GitHub releases for release notes
gh release create v1.0.0 --title "Initial Release" --notes "First version of engineering standards"
```

### 3. Configure Repository Access (for private repos)

If your canonical repository is private, you must allow other repositories to use its reusable workflows:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
2. Scroll to **"Access"** section
3. Select **"Accessible from repositories in the 'OWNER' organization"**

Without this, downstream repos will see: `error parsing called workflow: workflow was not found`

### 4. Set Up Downstream Repositories

In each downstream repository:

```bash
agconf init --source my-org/engineering-standards
```

### 5. Configure Downstream Workflow Settings (Optional)

Each downstream repository can optionally customize sync behavior (commit strategy, PR settings, reviewers). See [Downstream Repository Configuration](./DOWNSTREAM_REPOSITORY_CONFIGURATION.md) for details.

## Cross-Repository Authentication

For the sync workflows to function, downstream repositories need read access to the canonical repository. The generated `sync-reusable.yml` workflow supports two authentication methods out of the box:

1. **GitHub App** (recommended) - More secure, granular permissions, higher rate limits
2. **Personal Access Token (PAT)** - Simpler setup, but tied to a user account

You only need to configure **one** of these. The reusable workflow validates that either a PAT or both GitHub App secrets are provided, and automatically generates an ephemeral token when using the App method.

**Note:** The `check` workflow (`agconf-check.yml`) does **not** require any tokens or secrets. It only runs `agconf check` to verify file integrity within the repository.

### Secret Naming Convention

Secret names are derived from the marker prefix in your `agconf.yaml`. The prefix is uppercased with dashes converted to underscores:

| Marker Prefix | PAT Secret | App ID Secret | App Private Key Secret |
|---------------|------------|---------------|------------------------|
| `agconf` | `AGCONF_TOKEN` | `AGCONF_APP_ID` | `AGCONF_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` |
| `fbagents` | `FBAGENTS_TOKEN` | `FBAGENTS_APP_ID` | `FBAGENTS_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` |
| `my-prefix` | `MY_PREFIX_TOKEN` | `MY_PREFIX_APP_ID` | `MY_PREFIX_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` |

### Option 1: GitHub App (Recommended)

A GitHub App provides better security and granular permissions. The app is installed on repositories rather than tied to a user.

#### Step 1: Create the GitHub App

1. Go to your organization settings: `https://github.com/organizations/YOUR-ORG/settings/apps`
   - For personal accounts: `https://github.com/settings/apps`

2. Click **"New GitHub App"**

3. Configure the app:
   - **GitHub App name**: `agconf-sync` (or your preferred name)
   - **Homepage URL**: Your organization URL or repo URL
   - **Webhook**: Uncheck "Active" (not needed for this use case)

4. Set **Repository permissions**:
   - **Contents**: Read-only (to read canonical repo)
   - **Metadata**: Read-only (required, auto-selected)

5. Under **"Where can this GitHub App be installed?"**:
   - Select **"Only on this account"** for organization-only use
   - Or **"Any account"** if repos span multiple orgs

6. Click **"Create GitHub App"**

#### Step 2: Generate a Private Key

1. After creating the app, scroll down to **"Private keys"**
2. Click **"Generate a private key"**
3. A `.pem` file will download - **keep this secure**

#### Step 3: Note the App ID

The **App ID** is found at the top of the app settings page.

#### Step 4: Install the App

1. Go to your app's page and click **"Install App"** in the sidebar
2. Install it on your organization (or select specific repositories)
3. Grant access to the canonical repository

#### Step 5: Add Secrets to Downstream Repositories

Add these secrets to your **downstream repositories** (or at the organization level for convenience):

| Secret Name | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| `{PREFIX}_APP_ID` | Your GitHub App ID (e.g., `123456`) |
| `{PREFIX}_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | Contents of the `.pem` private key file |

For example, with the default `agconf` prefix:

| Secret Name | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| `AGCONF_APP_ID` | Your GitHub App ID |
| `AGCONF_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | Contents of the `.pem` private key file |

To add at organization level:
1. Go to **Organization Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Add each secret with **"All repositories"** or **"Selected repositories"**

No workflow modification is needed - the generated `sync-reusable.yml` already handles GitHub App token generation using `actions/create-github-app-token@v1`.

### Option 2: Personal Access Token (PAT)

A PAT is simpler to set up but is tied to a user account. Use fine-grained PATs for better security.

#### Step 1: Create a Fine-Grained PAT

1. Go to: `https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta`
2. Click **"Generate new token"**
3. Configure:
   - **Token name**: `agconf-sync`
   - **Expiration**: Choose an appropriate duration (90 days recommended)
   - **Repository access**: Select your canonical repository

4. Set **Repository permissions**:
   - **Contents**: Read-only

5. Click **"Generate token"** and copy the token

#### Step 2: Add Token as Secret

Add the token to your downstream repositories:

1. Go to each downstream repo → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Click **"New repository secret"**
3. Name: `{PREFIX}_TOKEN` (e.g., `AGCONF_TOKEN`)
4. Value: Paste your PAT

Or add at organization level for all repos.

### How Authentication Works in the Workflow

The generated `sync-reusable.yml` handles both methods automatically:

1. **Validation**: Fails early if neither a PAT nor both App secrets are provided
2. **Token generation**: If no PAT is provided, uses `actions/create-github-app-token@v1` to generate an ephemeral token from the GitHub App credentials
3. **Token usage**: The sync step uses `steps.app-token.outputs.token || secrets.token` to pick the right credential

The downstream workflow passes all three secrets through to the reusable workflow:

```yaml
secrets:
  token: ${{ secrets.AGCONF_TOKEN }}
  app_id: ${{ secrets.AGCONF_APP_ID }}
  app_private_key: ${{ secrets.AGCONF_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

Only the secrets you've actually configured will have values - the others will be empty, and the reusable workflow handles this gracefully.

### Pushing Changes from Canonical to Downstream

If you want the canonical repository to automatically push changes to downstream repos when you release a new version:

#### Using Repository Dispatch

1. In your canonical repository, create a release workflow that triggers downstream repos:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/notify-downstream.yml
name: Notify Downstream Repos

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        repo:
          - my-org/app-one
          - my-org/app-two
          - my-org/app-three
    steps:
      - name: Generate GitHub App Token
        id: app-token
        uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v1
        with:
          app-id: ${{ secrets.AGCONF_APP_ID }}
          private-key: ${{ secrets.AGCONF_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          owner: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
          repositories: ${{ matrix.repo }}

      - name: Trigger downstream sync
        run: |
          curl -X POST \
            -H "Authorization: token ${{ steps.app-token.outputs.token }}" \
            -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
            https://api.github.com/repos/${{ matrix.repo }}/dispatches \
            -d '{"event_type": "agconf-release", "client_payload": {"version": "${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}"}}'
```

2. The downstream repos' sync workflow already listens for `repository_dispatch` events with type `{prefix}-release` (with dashes replaced by underscores, e.g., `agconf_release`).

### Security Best Practices

1. **Prefer GitHub Apps over PATs** - Apps have granular permissions and aren't tied to user accounts
2. **Minimize permissions** - Only grant the permissions actually needed
3. **Use short token expiration** - For PATs, set reasonable expiration (90 days or less)
4. **Rotate credentials regularly** - Regenerate private keys and PATs periodically
5. **Use organization-level secrets** - Easier to manage and audit than per-repo secrets
6. **Audit access logs** - Review GitHub App and PAT usage in security logs

## Maintenance

### Updating Standards

1. Edit files in your canonical repository
2. Commit and push changes
3. Create a new release tag
4. Downstream repos can update with `agconf sync`

### Adding New Skills

1. Create new skill directory under `skills/`
2. Add `SKILL.md` with proper frontmatter
3. Commit, push, and create release
4. Downstream repos receive the skill on next sync

### Deprecating Skills

1. Remove the skill directory
2. Create a new release
3. Downstream repos will be prompted to delete orphaned skills on sync

## Troubleshooting

### "workflow was not found" in downstream CI

Your canonical repository is private and hasn't been configured to share workflows. See [Configure Repository Access](#3-configure-repository-access-for-private-repos).

### Skills not appearing in downstream repos

1. Verify the skill has valid frontmatter (`name` and `description` required)
2. Check that `skills_dir` in `agconf.yaml` matches your directory structure
3. Run `agconf sync` in the downstream repo

### Workflow files not being created in downstream repos

Workflow files are only created when syncing from a GitHub source (not `--local` mode). Use:

```bash
agconf init --source my-org/engineering-standards
```
