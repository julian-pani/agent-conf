# npm Package Transfer Request: `agx`

**To**: support@npmjs.com
**Subject**: Package transfer request: agx

---

Hi npm Support,

I'm writing to request a transfer of the package name `agx`.

## Current State of `agx`

- **Version**: 0.0.0 (never meaningfully published)
- **Last updated**: ~4 years ago
- **Downloads**: [likely minimal/zero]
- **Content**: Placeholder with no functional code

## My Use Case

I'm the author of [agent-conf](https://github.com/julian-pani/agent-conf), an actively developed CLI tool for managing AI agent configurations (AGENTS.md, skills, instructions) across repositories. The tool is already published on npm as `agent-conf`.

I'm planning to expand this into a platform for AI developer experience tooling, and `agx` ("Agent Experience") would be the ideal short name for the CLI command. The project has:

- Active development: https://github.com/julian-pani/agent-conf
- Published releases on npm
- Real users and documentation
- Planned roadmap for expansion

## Request

Given that `agx` appears to be an abandoned placeholder (0.0.0 for 4 years with no meaningful content), I'd like to request that the package be transferred to my npm account so I can use it for this legitimate, actively-maintained project.

My npm username: [YOUR_NPM_USERNAME]

Thank you for considering this request. Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
Julian Pani

## Notes for Julian

1. **Before sending**: Run `npm view agx` to confirm current state and add specific details
2. **Fill in**: Your npm username
3. **Optional**: Include download stats if you can find them (probably zero)
4. **Timeline**: Expect 1-2 weeks for response
5. **Backup plan**: If denied, use `agentconf` with `agx` as a bin alias, or scoped `@agx/cli`
